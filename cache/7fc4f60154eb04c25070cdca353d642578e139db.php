<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>In the 5th hour of the 4th day of the 3rd week of the 2nd grade, my car got stolen. But I didn't know it.</p>
<p>&quot;Hot Wheels is a brand of die-cast toy cars introduced by American toy maker Mattel in 1968.&quot; Nine years after that, I was 7. I had several of these fantastic play things. My favorite was the Black Trans Am.</p>
<p>I had the black 1977 Pontiac Trans Am, just like the one used in the movie Smokie and the Bandit. When my dad took us for speedy ride around all the curves of a local park, my heart was in my throat. It was so fun. I was in love.</p>
<p>When the teacher stuck out her hand and said; &quot;I've asked you several times not to play with cars in the classroom. You can get it on the last day of school.&quot; -- I believed her. I gave up my Trans Am.</p>
<p>Fast forward 159 school days and I hop off the bus on the last day of school. As I look into the drawer of loot, my car isn't there. </p>
<p>&quot;Where is it?&quot; I ask. </p>
<p>The teacher didn't remember taking it.</p>
<p>An hour later, I see Steve playing with it. </p>
<p>&quot;Hey, that's my Trans Am!!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nope, it's mine.&quot; - he smiled.</p><?php $__env->stopSection(); ?>
