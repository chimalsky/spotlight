<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><h1>Prep like a really good chef</h1>
<p>Have you ever seen them at work?</p>
<p>(Go and watch Chef's Table if you don't know what I'm talking about.)</p>
<p>Everything is ready.</p>
<p>The tools.</p>
<p>Much of the ingredients.</p>
<p>The bench is wiped down.</p>
<p>Everything is in its place.</p>
<p>It's not because only hyper particular people become chefs.</p>
<p>It's because--when service comes round--it's necessary to avoid complete chaos.</p>
<p>So much will happen that is outside of their control so they control the environment.</p>
<p><strong>The same is true for you</strong></p>
<h1>Ready like a really good martial artist</h1>
<p>If a fight is to happen, they piece together moves that they've done over and over again.</p>
<p>The moves are as rehearsed as they can be.</p>
<p>But they are great improvisers.</p>
<p>But the choices are all reactive, relying on instinct and new information.</p>
<p><strong>The same is true for you</strong></p>
<h1>No one is going to make you prepare or rehearse</h1>
<p>It's entirely on you to set your standards.</p>
<p>It's entirely on you to determine what the work requires.</p>
<p>It's not useful to rely on your comfort levels.</p>
<p>On one hand you could be very comfortable crash landing into the work.
Could being prepared improve the work? Would it be worth the time and effort to make that improvement?</p>
<p>On the other hand you could tend towards over-preparing.
Is it improving the work? Is your task to sit with the discomfort of not knowing how it will turn out instead of overpreparing?</p><?php $__env->stopSection(); ?>
