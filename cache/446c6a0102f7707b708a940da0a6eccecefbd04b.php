<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Reasons why my friends are quitting or moving on to other roles after 2 years of graduating form college.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;The firm I am at is old school and I don't get credit for what I do. Only the managers do.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;My boss micro manages.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Found out they were not paying market rate and they were taking advantage of me.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Cost of living is too high for the salary that I am making.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I need to get out of the city but more importantly from my parents.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The role is not what I expected and this is something that I don't want to do&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Life is too short to be looking at spreadsheets all day&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I just want to make more money&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;My co-workers make my life miserable by spreading rumors. I am pretty sure they are just insecure of their work&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I want to study more and be an expert in my field&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I don't know what I want to do yet and I am going to explore few more fields before I settle down&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I want to make music&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Tech might be my thing and I want to join a bootcamp&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Can't see growth at the firm and there are too many team politics.&quot;</li>
