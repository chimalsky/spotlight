<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>So... how did I end up in front of this Goya? </p>
<p>Minutes earlier, I hadn't even known that as its name. Even so, this plant was the first detail that stuck out when I let myself in through the frosted glass door.</p>
<p>The suite felt absolutely different than before. But other than the Goya, I couldn't spot anything else off. I slowly painted the walls and floors with my eyes, trying to find something else that had changed. </p>
<p>Something inside me kept me from flicking on the lights. Just as my finger was about to reach the switch, the office beckoned whatever was inside me. I walked in to find a single note, along with a bottle of whiskey, on top of the desk.</p>
<pre><code>I trust you have upheld your end of the deal. One minor issue has cropped up. 
I donâ€™t expect to be returning to the office. Maybe you can get some use out 
of it while this all blows over. I even had a Goya put up for you 
in the reception space.

Sincerely,
Ball</code></pre>
<p>I must've read the note five times. Through the window I heard the city coming alive. Cars. People going out to bars. Noise of humans. Still holding onto the note, I returned to Mr. Ball's office to pour myself a drink, I noticed that the portrait on the wall was gone. </p><?php $__env->stopSection(); ?>
